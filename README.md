For the labs below, two datasets were fused together with the data of Anime and Manga from myanimelist.net. They were cleaned and prepped for coding and visualization using d3.v3 (for lab 2) and d3.v7 for the rest of the labs to account for specific functions that were not available in the lower version.

Labs 2 through 4 were the simplified dashboards so that students could learn how to utilize/create the graphs explained to us during the lecture. The final lab, Lab 5, is a dashboard where the student would get the choice of selecting graphs they created from Lab 2-4 and portray it in such a way that it tells a story about a dataset.

A demo of the dashboard can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d1ynuFmlSY&list=PLyCRt3MN8s8O9U9_c2T2R-CDoxVhmnb53&index=4)
